# Contributing to DIEMS App Backend

**:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:**

This is a completely Open Source project. So anyone can contribute. I'm especially looking for:

* Security enhancements
* Additional features (without changing the current functionality)

## How to contribute

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone it locally to your system
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/diems-app-backend
    ```
3. Create a new branch for your patch or feature
    ```bash
    $ git branch <feature_name>
    ```
4. Go through the [README](README.md) for getting started with the project. Make your changes.
5. Add your code/patch.
    ```bash
    $ git add <files>
    ```
6. Commit your work, and write good/unambiguous commit messages
    ```bash
    $ git commit -m "A nice commit message"
    ```
7. Push it to your origin repository
    ```bash
    $ git push origin master
    ```
8. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/deshmukhmayur/diems-app-backend/compare) for your patch/feature

At this point, you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on your pull requests within 3 working days. I may suggest some changes or improvements.

Some things that will increase the chance of your pull request getting accepted:

1. Following good coding standards (good variable names, well indented code, self-explanatory code, with minimal but clear comments)
2. Writing [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
